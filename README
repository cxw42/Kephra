NAME
    kephra - crossplatform, GUI-Texteditor designed along Perl's Paradigms 

SYNOPSIS
        > kephra [<files>]   # start with certain files open

DESCRIPTION
    This module install's a complete editor application with all its configs
    and documentation for your programming, web and text authoring.

  Philosophy
    I know, I know, there are plenty text editors out there, even some really
    mighty IDE, but still no perfect solution for many programmers. So lets
    learn from Perl what it takes to build a tool thats powerful and fun to
    play with for hours and months.
    
    * make a low entry barrier
    * copy what people like and are used to
    * give choices (Timtowtdi) 
     * (e.g. deliver vi and emacs input style)
     * usable with mouse and keyboard commands and menus
     * configure via dialog and yaml/conf files ...
    
    Furthermore i made some design decisions that should define Kephra:
    
    * beautiful, well crafted GUI with own Icons
    * everything is optional / configurable
    * solve things with minimal effort (no bloat / minimal dependencies)
    * turn CPAN into a IDE and provide just the glue
    
    I believe strongly that there is much more possible with GUI editors
    and text editors in general than we are used today. So I try to design
    Kephra in a way, that every programmer can alter and extend it easily.
    That can speed up progress or at least makes Kephra more comfortable 
    for you.

    That is the plan, but we are currently not nearly that far.

  Features
    Beside all the basic stuff that would you expect from a notepad, we have
    file sessions, simple templates, recent closed files, and file functions
    applied to all files, where it makes sense.
    
    We have also a pile of advanced text navigation (on braces or blockwise),
    goto last edit or 10 doc spanning Bookmarks as well as find in files. 
    
    Advanced undo, line editing (edit functions that take the current line as
    input), move selected text by mouse or keyboard. Formating funtions like 
    blockformat, align blocks, indenting, commenting ...
    
    Documents have several properties like syntax styling, auto indention, tab
    width, tab use, write protection.

    View options contain switches for any GUI element and marker for: current
    line, end of line bytes, right margin, indetion guides, bracehiglighting,
    line wrap and font.

    Every menu and toolbar is evaluated from a simple yaml file, so you can 
    change it easily by opening this files from the config menu.


ROADMAP

  Stable Release 0.4

    This release was about getting the editor liquid or highly configurable.
    Its also about improvements in the user interface and of course the little
    things we missed. It also contains interpreter output panel and a notepad.

  Stable Release 0.5

    code folding, utf ready, Plugin API, good test suite and easy CPAN install

  Stable Release 0.6

    the tools: tidy, outlining, snippet/tool tree, syntaxmode aware commenting
