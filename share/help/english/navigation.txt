 Despite the editor is designed to be nonintrusive, every element of the user
 interface has its planned purpose and task. The usage will be easier if you
 know something about but please don't be bored because much of it is common
 knowledge. And if you want to change something just look into the menu "Config".

Mainmenu: 
 Is located topmost at the main window and gives you an overview about
 most available features. To be be able to search features in context it is
 thematically structured with many submenus and subsubmenus and provides a quick
 overview about every feature with information about its keyboard shortcut, its
 representing icon and a short help text in the statusbar.
 
Toolbar: 
 Is located below the main menu and contains only the icons of the most used 
 functions. That should enable fast work for people who prefer to work with
 the mouse.

Tabbar:
 shows which files are currently open and some information if the files are 
 unsaved or readonly. You can select the active or even close files(currently 
 only the selected) via tabbar.

Context menu: 
 opens with a click of the right mouse button and provides most important 
 functions that stay in connection with the place the menu is called. 
 
Status bar: 
 Is located at the bottom line of the main window. It provides
 informations about the current status and feedback from your instructions.
 Some parts of it are interactive(left-click) and have their own 
 context menu(right-click).
